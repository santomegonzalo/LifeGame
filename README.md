# LifeGame

This game is based on [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

## UI 

You will find the solution on index.html

The UI is really simple, by default the grid is empty and have a size of 40x40 with 10 of cell size. If we press **START GAME** button, the game will start with pre defined data. But the user could click on ever cell to select which data he want to use... the cells will change the color... and **START GAME** button will use that data to play the game.
